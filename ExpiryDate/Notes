Notes


The following are inconsistenics/issues that I noticed that I would discuss with a designer before I choose to take the non-standard or more time/resource intensive approach.

1) In the interest of time, boxes around both done buttons and the picker were ommitted since they are not standard iOS features.

2) Intentionally or not, October is misspelled " OV"

3) There are 2 different expired dates notification statements in the directions.

4) Both done button instructions check for date validation and thus repetative.
